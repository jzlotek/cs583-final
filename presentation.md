# Intro To Paper

- Goal and Approach
- Their Results
- So we looked at the data

# Demo?

- Start Immediately

# Short Commings of Implemetation

- Python2
- Various Code Deprecations
- Pre trained Models were not good (from Google Drive)
- Hardware Requirements are Unacceptable
- Provided Code is Unusable (hard to play with)
- Restricted to 2 Camera Brands/Families
- File types: ARW, RAF

# Show Our Results/Improvements

- Memory usage decresed
- Provide:
- Web app
- CLI interface/Module
- Refactored Code to prevent copy and paste
- IPython notebook (Google Colab)

# Going Forward

- Supporting more raw formats
- General JPG/PNG implementation
- Provide more information to why/how this works (visualization)
- Better hosting solution for dataset
- Put it in an App and charge \$5
